Fake JNIC native obfuscator that sales for 8000CNY ~= 1000USD (The dev team said they spend 7000USDT to buy the JNIC source code)<br>
We found MyJ2C used a lot of code from (https://github.com/radioegor146/native-obfuscator) but MyJ2C did not follow GPL-3.0 license<br>
<b><h3>It has almost the same security and performance as JNIC</h3></b><br>
